# Codira Package Manager Design Docs

Codira Package Manager design is done in open source, and governed by Codira Evolution process.
As such, you can find up-to-date Codira Package Manager design docs [in the Codira Evolution repository](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/tree/main/proposals).

This directory contains documentation on the engineering design decisions and internals of the Codira Package Manager, outside the evolution process.
