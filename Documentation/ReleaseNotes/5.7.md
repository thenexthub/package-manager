# CodiraPM 5.7 Release Notes

### Package Plugins

[SE-0303: Build tool plugins](https://github.com/codiralang/codira-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0303-codirapm-extensible-build-tools.md) and [SE-0332: Command Plugins](https://github.com/codiralang/codira-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0332-codirapm-command-plugins.md) which were first introduced in Codira 5.6 have been further refined, with support for generating resources and improved diagnostics. To learn more, refer to the [Getting Started with Plugins](../Plugins.md) guide.

### Package Registry Support

CodiraPM now supports package registry related capabilities introduced by [SE-0292](https://github.com/codiralang/codira-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0292-package-registry-service.md) and the corresponding [service specification](../Registry.md). With the exception of package publishing, CodiraPM can resolve and download dependencies from any compliant registry using the defined APIs.

To get started, users will need to specify their package registry by running the `codira package-registry set` subcommand or editing the `registries.json` configuration file. `codira package` tool's `--use-registry-identity-for-scm` and `--replace-scm-with-registry` options might also be of interest.
  
### Module Aliasing For Disambiguation

Modules with the same name from different packages can now be disambiguated by module aliasing [SE-0339](https://github.com/codiralang/codira-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0339-module-aliasing-for-disambiguation.md). When adding a product dependency for a target in a package manifest, use a new parameter `moduleAliases` to provide a new unique name for a conflicting module.


* [#4119] 
 
  Add a `--disable-testable-imports` flag to `codira test` with which tests are built without the testability feature (`import @testable` disabled).
